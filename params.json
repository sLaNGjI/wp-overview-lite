Upload it into your plugins directory.\r\n2. It will create a directory /wp-content/plugins`/wp-overview-lite/`\r\n3. Go to plugins page and active WP Overview (lite)\r\n= For users of old WPMU =\r\n1. If you are using WordPress MU `wp-overview-lite.php` must be put directly into the directory /wp-content`/mu-plugins/`\r\n2. Activate of WP Overview (lite) should be `AutomaTTic` ;)\r\n= How to uninstall WP Overview (lite) =\r\n1. Disable WP Overview (lite) from Menu Plugins of Control Panel.\r\n2. Delete WP Overview (lite) from Menu Plugins of Control Panel.\r\n= Troubleshooting =\r\nIf all else fails and your site is broken remove directly via ftp on your host space /home/your-wp-install-dir/wp-content/plugins/wp-overview-lite/ or /home/your-wp-install-dir/wp-content/mu-plugins/wp-overview-lite.php\r\n== Frequently Asked Questions ==\r\n= Dashboard Widget Not For Subscribers =\r\nRESOLVED [Dashboard Widget Not For Subscribers](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-overview-lite-dashboard-footer-memory-usage-request-dashboard-widget-not-for-subscribers): [try it here](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-overview-lite.zip) (WP 3.0.1 or later required to run)\r\nThe regular subscribers get to see the same info of Admin and Super Admin on multi-site installations. For most it's just confusing, for others it's too much info on server background and it might be considered a security risk for sites where user registration is open to everyone. The beta solution implemented, for now, only on the development release is to allow only the admin, and super admin on multi-site installations, to see the dashboard widget, and everyone to see memory load footer. Thanks to [RavanH](http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/RavanH/) for this [security fix](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-overview-lite-dashboard-footer-memory-usage-request-dashboard-widget-not-for-subscribers).\r\n= Admin Bar: Frontend PHP Error Message =\r\nRESOLVED [Admin Bar: Frontend PHP Error Message](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-overview-lite-dashboard-memory-load-usage-admin-bar-frontend-php-error-message)\r\nFor a system error uploading the development version has been posted as the official version. This is the problem. The release has just been re-charged. To resolve this problem just simple delete the plugin from your installation of wordpress, and after that reinstall it again. Everything will be magically solved ;)\r\n= WP3 exceed 256 memory limit? =\r\nRESOLVED [WP3 exceed 256 memory limit](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp3-exeed-256-memory-limit?replies=5)\r\nWordPress 3.0 Multi-site: 256 MB Memory Requirements?\r\nWordPress Multi-site unofficially needs 256 Megabyte of Memory, but only for admin backend panel, not for the user frontend!\r\nThis is a very high value, and is not announced in the minimum WordPress requirements since the 2.7 version. See also: [Technical WordPress Installation Checklist](http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Hakre/Technical_Installation)\r\nBecause raising the memory limit over your servers allowance can crash your blog on some servers, or shared hosting, (Fatal Error: Allowed Memory Size Exhausted) it’s adviseable, previous to upgrade, increase your WordPress Memory Limit with third part plugins like [Memory Bump](http://wordpress.org/plugins/memory-bump/), and check how much PHP or WP Memory your server allows with WP Overview or similar.\r\nIf it’s below 256 Megabytes this could render your blog useless after upgrade, and it means you need to increase your WordPress Memory Limit. Related Ticket: [Ticket #13847](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13847)\r\nFor this bug #13847 [WP Overview (lite)](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-overview-lite/) and [WP Overview (lite) MU](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-overview-lite-mu/) need another upgrade to work fine on WP 3.0 environment.\r\nThe fix is already online on my reposytory [lite](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-overview-lite/trunk/) and [mu](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-overview-lite-mu/trunk/) and it official released after [WP 3.0.1](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.0.1) launch.\r\nI tested my plugin, on various scenario, and 48MB is a good chance for somes WP and MU~LTI-SITE installations to work fine.\r\n= Cannot Redeclare Class: wp_overview_lite =\r\nFatal error on reload after upgrade with WPMU Sitewide Plugins Mode: cannot redeclare `class wp_overview_lite` in /home/your-installation-of-wp-/wp-content/plugins/wp-overview-lite/wp-overview-lite.php on line ... This issue is only for WPMU users: WP users are not affected! This error is not fatal for the plugin or Wordpress: all it work correctly also after upgrading, but is needed re-activate WP Overview (lite) manually. No problem exist for WPMU users with the plugin on directory /mu-plugins/.\r\n= Network Activate Failed after Upgrading Plugin. =\r\nAfter upgrading the plugin, it is not plus Network re-Activate but local. Cause of this issue is one WP conflict with W3 Total Cache. All plugins have this issue not only WP Overview (lite). The solution is deactivate W3 Total Cache before any plugin update and reactivate W3 Total Cache it after updating is terminated.\r\n== Changelog ==\r\nsLa NGjI's Team do not provide support on wordpress.org forum and reviews!
